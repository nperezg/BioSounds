# BioSounds

## Description

BioSounds is a sound analysis web application for biological scientific research that generates sound spectrograms and allows animal tagging. Originally based on Pumilio, it has evolved into a new project. The code is being completely refactored and lots of new functionalities have been added. It still uses the Python spectrogram generation code from the original application, but this is going to be removed soon, as we intend to fully use the Web Audio API. Developed together with [Kevin Darras](https://github.com/kdarras), from the University of Goettingen.

## Comments

The application is still under development and within the refactoring process, so don't be surprised if certain parts are not yet clean code. We are working on it ;)
