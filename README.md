# BioSounds

__Description__

BioSounds is a sound analysis web application for biological scientific research that generates sound spectrograms and allows animal tagging. It was initially based on Pumilio, but it has been completely renewed, refactored and several new functionalities have been added. It still uses the spectrogram generation code made in Python from the original application, but this is going to be removed soon, as we intend to fully use the Web Audio API. 

__Comments__

The application is still in development and refactoring process, so don't be surprised is certain parts are not yet clean code. We are working on it ;)
